            Hello! I’m a web designer with a passion for creating user-friendly websites and applications. I have a
            background in industrial engineering, and I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful, and
            intuitive designs.
          </p>
          <p>
            My skills include HTML, CSS, Figma, AdobeXD and responsive design. When I’m not coding, I enjoy watching TV
            and running.
